\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
In this paper, we study how to exploit the low access latency 
of PIM memory to design efficient concurrent data structures for the PIM memory.
To analyze and compare the performance of our PIM-managed data structures with 
concurrent data structures in the literature, we propose a simplified 
performance model based on the latencies assumed by prior work on PIM
memory and on current multiprocessor architectures. 
We show that sequential PIM data structures cannot outperform traditional 
concurrent data structures, 
due to the lack of parallelism and the high communication cost between the CPUs and the PIM 
cores.  
To improve the performance of PIM data structures, we propose novel designs for    
low contention 
pointer-chasing data structures, such as linked-lists and skip-lists, and for high-contention  
data structures, such as FIFO queues. 
We show that our PIM algorithms can outperform state-of-the-art concurrent 
data structures, making PIM memory a promising platform for managing data structures.
