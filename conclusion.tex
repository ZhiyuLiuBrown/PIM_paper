\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
In this paper, we study how to exploit the low access latency 
of PIM memory to design efficient concurrent data structures for the PIM memory.
We analyze and compare the performance of our PIM-managed data structures with 
concurrent data structures in the literature.
To this end, we propose a simplified performance model for PIM memory. 
We show that naive PIM-managed data structures \emph{cannot} outperform traditional concurrent data structures, 
due to the lack of parallelism and the high communication cost between the CPUs and the PIM cores.  
To improve the performance of PIM data structures, we propose novel designs for low-contention 
pointer-chasing data structures, such as linked-lists and skip-lists, and for contended  
data structures, such as FIFO queues. 
We show that our PIM-managed data structures can outperform state-of-the-art concurrent 
data structures, making PIM memory a promising platform for managing data structures.
